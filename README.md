# bramble-config

Configuration files to generate a [bramble][bra], or cluster of [Raspberry Pi 3][rpi]
single-board computers running [Raspbian][rsp] and administered using [Ansible][ans].

*Caveat emptor*: a bramble is useful as an educational tool for IT
infrastructure testing, especially [queuing system][slr], [file system][zfs],
and [workflow][ans] research. It is ***not*** intended to perform useful
computational tasks: there are [better][mms] [options][hpc].
